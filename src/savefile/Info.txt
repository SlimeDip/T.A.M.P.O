T.A.M.P.O. save files

Location:
  src/savefile/

Files:
  - profiles.txt    : saved user profiles (created/updated by the game)
  - leaderboard.csv : saved scores (created/updated by the game)

Do not edit these files by hand — manual changes can break the game.
If you must modify them:
  1) For profile - Follow the format (Name|Gender|GenderAttractedTo|Personality|LoversName|LoversGender|LoversGenderAttractedTo|Language).
  2) For leaderboard - Follow the format (Name,Score)

If you want to reset data, delete the files and run the game; it will recreate them.
